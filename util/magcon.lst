*  1. ---------------------- PARENT MACHINE
                             EX.:  IBM 370/158, HP-2000, UNIVAC 1108, ETC.

*  2. ---------------------- NUMBER OF TRACKS
                             THE CHOICES ARE 7 OR 9 TRACKS

*  3. ---------------------- TAPE FORMAT
                             EX.:  EBCDIC, BCD, HPASCII, ASCII, ETC.

*  4. ---------------------- TAPE DENSITY
                             THE CHOICES FOR 7 TRACK TAPES ARE 556 OR
                             800 BPI (BITS PER INCH). THE CHOICES FOR
                             9 TRACK TAPES ARE 800, 1600, OR 6250 BPI.

*  5. ---------------------- TAPE PARITY - ODD OR EVEN
                             9 TRACK TAPES ARE ALWAYS ODD PARITY.

*  6. ---------------------- BLOCKING FACTOR
                             SPECIFY THE NUMBER OF LOGICAL RECORDS PER
                             BLOCK (PHYSICAL RECORD).

*  7. ---------------------- RECORD SIZE
                             STATE THE NUMBER OF CHARACTERS PER LOGICAL
                             RECORD. IF VARIABLE, STATE THE MAXIMUM NUMBER.

   8. ---------------------- STATE THE NUMBER OF RECORDS PER FILE.

   9. ---------------------- NUMBER OF FILES.

  10. ---------------------- TAPE LABEL (OR HEADER) - WHAT DOES THE 
                             LABEL (OR HEADER) CONSIST OF?
                             EX.: 2 RECORDS, OR 1 FILE, OR 32 CHAR-
                                  ACTERS OR NONE OF THE FIRST RECORD.

  11. ---------------------- LISTING INCLUDED (YES OR NO?).  THIS IS
                             SOMETIMES THE KEY TO A TOUGH CONVERSION.
                             SEEING WHAT THE DATA IS SUPPOSED TO LOOK
                             LIKE CAN REALLY HELP IN SELECTING THE COR-
                             RECT CONVERSION PARAMETERS.
