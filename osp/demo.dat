THIS IS A DEMONSTRATION DATA FILE TO ILLUSTRATE THE USE OF "GRAFIT".
THIS FILE CREATES TWO GRAPHS.  ON THE FIRST GRAPH, FOUR SETS OF DATA
ARE PLOTTED, FIRST AS DISCRETE POINTS AND THEN AS SECOND ORDER
APPROXIMATING CURVES.  ON THE SECOND GRAPH THE DATA IS SIMPLY REPRESENTED
AS STRAIGHT LINE SEGMENTS CONNECTING THE DATA POINTS. COMMENTS ON THE
FOLLOWING COPY OF THE DATA FILE MAY HELP IN UNDERSTANDING ITS STRUCTURE.
THE TEXT WHICH IS PRECEEDED BY A SLASH (/) IS EXPLANATORY AND WOULD
NOT NORMALLY APPEAR IN THE DATA FILE.
ALSO NOTE THAT THE LOWER CASE GREEK ALPHABET (ALPHA THRU OMEGA) IS
REPRESENTED HERE BY ASCII 97 THRU 120 (NORMALLY LOWER CASE A - X).
ASCII 121 AND 122 ARE CAPITAL SIGMA AND DELTA RESPECTIVELY.

**********************************************************************

	A FEW NOTES ON THE CHARACTER SET USED BY "GRAFIT"

**********************************************************************



	THE CHARACTERS <SPACE> THRU <]> (ASCII 32 THRU 93) ARE SIMPLY
PLOTTED AS UPPER CASE LETTERS, NUMERALS AND PUNCTUATION MARKS SIMILAR
TO THOSE APPEARING ON YOUR TERMINAL.  ASCII 94, 95 AND 96 ARE INTERPRETED
BY PLOTTER ROUTINES IN "GRAFIT" AS SPECIAL CONTROL CHARACTERS AS FOLLOWS:

^ (ASCII 94) CAUSES THE CHARACTER FOLLOWING IT TO BE SUPERSCRIPTED; THAT
		IS, THE NEXT CHARACTER WILL BE REDUCED IN SIZE BY .6 AND
		PLOTTED .5 CHARACTER HEIGHT HIGHER THAN THE REST OF THE
		LINE.  IF ONE REALLY WANTS TO PLOT AN ^ (ASCII 94)
		SIMPLY ENTER TWO CONSECUTIVELY IN THE CHARACTER STRING;
		THE SECOND ONE WILL BE PLOTTED NORMALLY.
		(THIS MEANS YOU CAN'T USE AN UPARROW AS A SUPERSCRIPT)
_ (ASCII 95) CAUSES AN EFFECTIVE BACKSPACE; THAT IS, THE
		CHARACTER FOLLOWING THE (ASCII 95) WILL BE PLOTTED AT
		THE SAME HORIZONTAL LOCATION AS THE CHARACTER PRECEEDING
		IT.  IF IT IS NECESSARY TO PLOT ASCII 95 (BACKARROW),
		PLACE TWO OF THEM CONSECUTIVELY IN THE STRING.
` (ASCII 96) CAUSES THE CHARACTER FOLLOWING IT TO BE A SUBSCRIPT.
		IF IT IS NECESSARY TO PLOT ASCII 96 (UNDERLINE) PLACE
		TWO OF THEM CONSECUTIVELY IN THE STRING.

	FOR INSTANCE, IF YOU WANTED TO HAVE "A SUB I SQUARED" PLOTTED
YOU MIGHT USE THE STRING A`I_^2 (ASCII 65, 96, 73, 95, 94, 50).


	AT THE PRESENT TIME THE LOWER CASE ALPHABET NORMALLY REPRESENTED
BY ASCII CODES 97 - 125 HAS BEEN REPLACED BY THE LOWER CASE GREEK
ALPHABET AND CAPITAL SIGMA, DELTA AND OTHER SYMBOLS USEFULL FOR PLOTTING
DATAPOINTS.  THUS a IS ALPHA, b IS BETA ETC. AS FOLLOWS:
a	IS ALPHA
b	IS BETA
c	IS GAMMA
d	IS DELTA
e	IS EPSILON
f	IS ZETA
g	IS ETA
h	IS THETA
i	IS IOTA
j	IS KAPPA
k	IS LAMBDA
l	IS MU
m	IS NU
n	IS XI
o	IS OMICRON
p	IS PI
q	IS RHO
r	IS SIGMA
s	IS TAU
t	IS UPSILON
u	IS PHI
v	IS CHI
w	IS PSI
x	IS OMEGA
y	IS CAPITAL SIGMA
z	IS CAPITAL DELTA (TRIANGLE)
{	IS AN INVERTED TRIANGLE
|	IS A SQUARE
}	IS A POINT (BIGGER AND CENTERED BETTER THAN A PERIOD)


	FOR THOSE OF YOU USING UPPER CASE ONLY TERMINALS NOTE THAT ALL
OF THE ABOVE LOWER CASE CODES MAY BE PLACED IN YOUR TEXT USING THE
nI CONSTRUCTION IN TECO.  THUS, A TECO COMMAND STRING TO INSERT "ALPHA
DIVIDED BY LAMBDA" IN THE TEXT BUFFER MIGHT LOOK LIKE: 97I$I/$107I$$

	IF YOU ANTICIPATE DOING MUCH OF THIS (AND EVEN IF YOU DON'T) YOU
SHOULD GET AHOLD OF THE "TECO POCKET GUIDE" (AVAILABLE AT THE BOOKSTORE
I BELIEVE). THIS BOOKLET CONTAINS A SUMMARY OF ALL TECO COMMANDS AND
A LIST OF THE ASCII CODES USED ON THE PDP-10.
