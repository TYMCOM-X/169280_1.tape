THAT IS CRITICAL TO US.  WE ARE HAVING A MEETING TOMORROW MORNING WITH 
THE CUSTOMER TO DISCUSS THIS TICKET.  THE TICKET WAS OPENED ON 8/8 AND
MAY HAVE STILL BE OPEN WHEN THE CRASH OCCURED.  IS IT POSSIBLE TO 
FIND OUT IF ANY BACKUPS WERE DONE ON 8/8, 8/9, 8/10 AND 8/11 BEFORE 
THE CRASH OCCURED?  IF SO, WHAT CAN BE DONE TO RETREIVE THIS INFORMATION?
ANY HELP YOU CAN PROVIDE WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.  

THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR SYSTEM 26

THANK, YOU
MERLE GERHART
PLEASE NOTIFY ME AT 610/666-3411 OR CALL NSSC AT 800/345-6090 AND
ASK THEM TO PAGE ME.  I AM HERE TIL 4:00PM EDT TODAY.  THANK YOU.

THE FILES CAN BE MOVED BEFORE OR AFTER ANY SCHEDULED DOWNTIME WITH THE
FOLLOWING RESTRICTION.  NSSC RUNS THE "SHIFT REPORT" PROCEDURE BEGINNING
AT APPROXIMATELY 17:00 PST MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY.  THE PROCEDURE TAKES
APPROXIMATELY 3 TO 4 HOURS.  IF THE 'FILE  TRANSFER' IS TO BE DONE
AT A TIME OTHER THAN WHEN IT IS NORMALLY SCHEDULED THEN SOMEONE SHOULD
CHECK WITH NSSC TO MAKE SURE THE "SHIFT REPORT" IS NOT RUNNING.
